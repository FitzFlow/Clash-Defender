Hello !

This is our EPITECH Graphical Programming Project, named Clash Defender.
The goal of this project is to create a tower defense game, in C language with the CSFML Library.
And for create this game, we decided to choose the Clash Royal / Clash of Clans theme.
We decide to choose this theme because we likes Clash Royal and Clash of Clans univers, and because there are not tower defense game with this theme.

Now if you want to try, you need to compile the game file.

Use ```make or make re``` to compile and generate a executable file.

After that, you will have an executable named ```clash_defender```.

To launch to the game, just write this ```./clash_defender```.

Now enjoy !

Ps: We have developed this game with Fedora / macOS OS. with some library.
    You need to have them for a functional game.
